Housing waiting lists are done based on the time you've been registered. <br/>\r\n     A 'normal' student rooms runs about 250-300€ out of the centre, 350€-450€ in centre. Expect to pay about 50€ more in your first year. <br/>\r\n     Room availability tends to be highest December-May, as most students then tend to finish their study with low demand. \r\n\r\n### Food\r\n\r\n#### Dinner\r\nDecent, not too expensive (by Maastricht standards)\t\r\n\r\n* [General] Mensa in Economy Faculty building. (Use your UM card for extra discount)\r\n* [General] Preuverij @ Kakeberg 6 (near DKE)\r\n* [Pizza with group] Donatello's @ Tongersestraat 30 (near DKE)\r\n* [Vietnamese] Saigon Cuisine @ Boschstraat 113 (near Market) \r\n* Takeout, Grillroom Paru has a permanent 5€ deal on pizza's. (Some are better than others)\r\n\r\n#### Lunch\r\n\r\n* Cafetaria at ToneelAcademie. (next to DKE)\r\n\t\thttps://www.google.nl/maps/@50.8464853,5.6876115,3a,75y,153.08h,71.06t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sQeQkli54H0s6iC9QasWPnA!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en\r\n\r\nSecret entrance is the studded brown door, walk until you see a downwards staircase on your left, follow it down until you get to the cafetaria.\r\n\r\n\t\tProtip: After a hangover, order eggs on bread + ham,cheese and a freshly pressed glass  of juice. \r\n        Breakfast of kings for ~4€.\r\n\t\t(They have filter coffee & sandwiches as well)\r\n        \r\n* Law Faculty: sandwiches & lunch\r\n* Incognito serves coffee from time to time. (Check with members)\r\n        \r\n### Cooking\r\n\r\n* Great site, good food, not costly: http://www.budgetbytes.com/ <br/>\r\n\r\n\t\tProtip: Check out \"Taco Pasta\"\r\n        \r\n* Market on friday sells a bag of fruit/vegetables for 5€.\r\n* Go to the ALDI (cheaper supermarket) once in a while for 'stockups'.\r\n\r\n### Must have\r\n\r\n* Work late at night, or long hours on PC? Install F.Lux <br/>\r\n\t_(Ensures your eyes will last)_\r\n\r\n* Gym & Sports all year == 180€ @ UM Sport <br/>\r\n\t_Do some form of sport (e.g.: bouldering) as even the tiniest bit of exercise will give you energy._\r\n \r\n## Uni\r\n \r\n### Projects\r\n\r\n* Before starting *any* project; look up the problem in the book AI: Modern Approach (Russell & Norvig). <br/>\r\n\t_This generally saves you about 4 weeks of work_\r\n* There will come a time when running a long experiment for 3 days straight, where it will crash on the 3rd day without any output. <br/>\r\n\t_Obviously, day 4 is presentation day._\r\n    * Ensure that you write out results while an experiment runs to a text file. It's a one-liner you can lookup on Stackoverflow.\r\n* Depending on that one guy in your group to do the coding for you is the quickest way to fail DKE.\r\n\tYes, you will skate by. However, come the harder single assignments (year 2/3, Bachelor Thesis) you *will* crash and burn.\r\n* Learn about version control. <br/>\r\n\t* Lookup `Git` on Google\r\n\t* Get confused because of the pages upon pages of documentation, then download `SmartGIT`\r\n\t* Learn to select files, then press `Commit`.\r\n    * Come to the understanding that you now have the power to `\"quick-save\"` any and all documents, not just code, and go back in time.\r\n    * Regret all life decisions as you did not commit your work during that all-nighter before the presentation and you can't replicate your results... or get any results for that matter.\r\n    * Seriously, before changing anything, *COMMIT YOUR WORK*.\r\n* Learn about `LaTeX`. No, not that kind of latex.\r\n\t* Use `TexMaker`, `Overleaf` or some online WYSIWYG LaTeX editor.\r\n* Might seem like a no-brainer but.. attend the project examinations.\r\n\r\n### Books & Articles:\r\n\r\n* PDF/Epubs of books and articles you legally own can be easily obtained from: <br/>\r\n\thttp://gen.lib.rus.ec/\r\n\t_(All sorts of literature, including comics etc)_\r\n* Get a Incognito membership, it pays itself back after the first 2 booksales.\r\n* Check with your professor whether the literature has changed recently. If not, get it second hand from Facebook, or use your social skills.\r\n\t\r\n### Studying\r\n\r\n* *Time management*. The key to success is to identify when you will be swamped with work, and when not, and plan around that.\r\n\t* Week 1-4 in a block are the \"Party/holiday\" weeks.\r\n\t* Week 5-7 are the \"Now lets get shit done\" weeks.\r\n* No matter how well you got by doing things last minute in high-school / previous programs, you will crash and burn if you maintain the same attitude at DKE.\r\n\t* Cry {INSERT TIME X} from now when you realize that we told you this and you choose to ignore it.\r\n\t* No, this is not a challenge to showcase how intelligent you are because you *could* finish course _X_ while you \"only studied the night before\" / \"not at all\".\r\n\t* Realize that discipline vs. intelligence is very much like the tortoise vs the hare.\r\n* Realize that every year builds upon the knowledge in the years before.<br/>\r\n\t  _Courses, in general, aren't standalone._\r\n      \r\n\t* Yes, you might finish `Calculus` with a 6 by cramming hard last minute. But you'll pay for it every math course coming afterwards.\r\n* **BONUS EXERCISES**: Easy way to get your grade up, and they often come back on exams.\r\n* If you are easily distracted:\r\n\t* Try to limit any and all distractions. Try studying at the library / DKE (see next section), change your OS, etc.\r\n\t* Study in 45-minute intervals, reward yourself after each interval. (go outside, etc)\r\n\r\n\t\r\n### Exams\r\n* During normal semesters you will be swamped with project work in the week before exams. <br/>\r\n\t\tThere are two kinds of students:\r\n        \r\n\t* Those who study in week 6 (or earlier) instead of 7, and pass.\r\n    * And those that don't because they have to finish the project presentation, code, report, experiments AND FINALLY study.\r\n    \r\n* Review before exams with a group of students. \r\n\r\n\t\tProtip #1: Rooms at DKE are mostly deserted the days leading up to exams. \r\n\t\tProtip #2: Use 1.001/2.009 as your personal lair of studying, with optional private cinema display of Judge Dredd at the end of the day (beamer!)\r\n\t\tProtip #3: CodePoKE (company founded by DKE students) provides a working spot for DKE students if the library & DKE are too crowded. Often there are senior students there you can ask questions to. Contact Gijs-Jan Roelofs, or someone from Incognito who can get into contact.\r\n* Bring snacks & water (e.g.: bananas). But don't you dare bring anything that makes noise.\r\n* http://wiki.msvincognito.nl tends to have old exams you can use to practice.\r\n\r\n### Programming\r\n\r\n* Programming subjects are ideal for self study. <br/>\r\n\t\t_Your development environment (IDE) and compiler give you an interactive feedback loop that quickly allows you to learn how to properly program. You have an automated system that will provide you with corrections._\r\n* For those new to programming, realize that you are learning three things at once:\r\n\t* A new language; its syntax and vocabulary (API)\r\n\t* A new way of thinking; how to go from problem to code.\r\n\t* How to debug a logical program, and doubt everything about yourself. <br/>\r\n\t_Divide up the learning process into these three categories and tackle them individually_\r\n* If you find that all of these things above are too much all at once, use an online code learning website such as codecombat.com. \r\n\t* They tend to use a more forgiving language.\r\n\t* They provide more 'meaningful' and shorter challenges. Above all, they give proper hints and personal feedback.\r\n* Realize that truly learning how to program comes by doing projects of *your* interest.\r\n* If you don't know what `Stackoverflow` is, google it and learn to love it.\r\n\t\r\n### Math\r\n* Realize that there is a ton of high-quality study material on the internet that you can partake in at your own speed, and ask questions on anonymously.\r\n\t* Calculus: https://www.khanacademy.org/\r\n\t* Linear Algebra: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/\r\n\t* See MIT Opencourseware, Coursera, Udacity; etc.\r\n\r\n\t\t\tCaveat: Online videos aren't a replacement to lectures, as sometimes courses require specific techniques outlined in said lectures.\r\n\r\n* If you have trouble understanding certain concepts, try searching online for \"visualizations\". Most often someone made a very good visualization of concepts that you can interact with to grasp a subject in minutes, that normally through text can take forever to grasp.\r\n\t* Eigenvalues & vectors: http://setosa.io/ev/eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues/\r\n\t* Markov Chains: http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/\r\n\t* Machine Learning: http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/\r\n\t\tetc....\r\n* Realize that doing the actual exercises is crucial for math courses.\r\n* Realize that you fundamentally lack the ability to review and correct your own exercises without outside help if you don't fully grasp the subject.\r\n\t* Get a solutions manual, preferable one that shows you the steps of calculation.\r\n\t* Setup a group of students to review the course material. Split it up the sessions in exercise making and theory review. Get an experienced student to help with the theory review.\r\n\t* Help a group of students if you are experienced. The best way to review theory is to see if you can explain it to someone else.\r\n\r\n## Professors\r\n\r\n* Prof. Kelk: Don't miss a single lecture. He is the best at explaining complex subjects.\r\n\r\n\t\tSeriously\r\n    \r\n* Prof. Thuijsman: Don't miss a single lecture. His syllabi tend to not cover techniques he explains in class.\r\n\r\n\t\tDouble seriously, you'll hate yourself come exam.\r\n       \r\n* Prof. Karel: Pay attention and write down everything said in his lectures. It will come back on exams.\r\n\r\n\t\tIt might save you an extra YEAR of studying\r\n\r\n## Social\r\n\r\n* DKE is relatively unique in the fact that due to its size students of all years tend to communicate with each other. <br/>\r\n\tKnowing someone from the years above you is a good thing (TM).\r\n* Incognito tends to organize a wide range of activities for people of varying interests.\r\n\t* Ask an aKTie member when certain events of interest will be hosted, or whom you can contact for certain interests.\r\n\r\n### Groups\r\n\r\n* Boardgames: https://www.facebook.com/groups/395260880543893/\r\n* Programming: https://www.facebook.com/groups/937739742957425/\r\n\r\n## Sights\r\n\r\n* Carnaval (around February) is something you should have witnessed once. <br/> A 'gentle` introduction is done on November 11th on the Vrijthof.\r\n* Go to the top of the local \"mountain\", Sint Pietersberg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t",
