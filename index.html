<p>Secret entrance behind brown door, go in, walk until you have a downwards staircase on your left, follow down and further until you get to the cafetaria.</p>

<pre><code>    Protip: After a hangover, order eggs on bread + ham,cheese and a freshly pressed glass  of juice. 
    Breakfast of kings for ~4€.

<h3>
<a id="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>

<ul>
<li>Before starting <em>any</em> project; look up the problem in the book AI: Modern Approach (Russell &amp; Norvig). <br>
<em>This generally saves you about 4 weeks of work</em>
</li>
<li>There will come a time where you will have run an experiment for 3 days, and it will crash on the 3rd day without any output. <br>
<em>Obviously, day 4 is presentation day.</em>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that you write out results while running to a text file. It's a one-liner you can lookup on Stackoverflow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Depending on that one guy in your group to do the coding for you is the quickest way to fail DKE.
Yes, you will skate by. However, come the harder single assignments (year 2/3, Bachelor Thesis) you <em>will</em> crash and burn.</li>
<li>Learn about version control. <br>

<ul>
<li>Lookup <code>Git</code> on Google</li>
<li>Cry because you do not understand a single thing about it, then download <code>SmartGIT</code>
</li>
<li>And learn to press <code>Stage</code> then <code>Commit</code>.</li>
<li>Come to the understanding that you now have the power to <code>"quick-save"</code> any and all documents and go back in time.</li>
<li>Regret all life decisions as you did not commit your work during that all-nighter before the presentation and you can't replicate your results or get any results for that matter.</li>
<li>Seriously, before changing anything, <em>COMMIT YOUR WORK</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn about <code>LaTeX</code>. No, not that kind of latex.

<ul>
<li>Use <code>TexMaker</code> or some online WYSIWYG LaTeX editor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="books--articles" class="anchor" href="#books--articles" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Books &amp; Articles:</h3>

<ul>
<li>PDF/Epubs of both books and articles you legally own can be easily obtained from: <br>
<a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/">http://gen.lib.rus.ec/</a>
<em>(All sorts of literature, including comics etc)</em>
</li>
<li>Get a Incognito membership, it pays itself back after the first 2 booksales.</li>
<li>Check with your professor whether the literature is still the same, get it second hand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="studying" class="anchor" href="#studying" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Studying</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Time management</em>. The key to success is to identify when you will be swamped with work, and when not, and plan around that.

<ul>
<li>Week 1-4 in a block are the "party/holiday" weeks.</li>
<li>Week 5-7 are the "now lets get shit done" weeks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No matter how well you got by doing things last minute in high-school / previous programs, you will crash and burn if you maintain the same attitude at DKE.

<ul>
<li>Cry {INSERT TIME X} from now when you realize that we told you this and you choose to ignore it.</li>
<li>No, this is not a challenge to showcase how intelligent you are because you <em>could</em> finish course <em>X</em> while you "only studied the night before" / "not at all".</li>
<li>Realize that discipline vs. intelligence is very much like the tortoise vs the hare.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Realize that every year builds upon the knowledge in the years before.<br>
  <em>Courses, in general, aren't standalone.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Yes, you might finish <code>Calculus</code> with a 6 by cramming hard last minute. But you'll pay for it every math course coming afterwards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="exams" class="anchor" href="#exams" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Exams</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>During normal semesters you will be swamped with project work in week before exams. <br>
    There are two kinds of students:</p>

<ul>
<li>Those who study in week 6 (or earlier) instead of 7, and pass.</li>
<li>And those that don't because they have to finish the project presentation, code, report, experiments AND FINALLY study.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review before exams with a group of students. </p>

<pre><code>Protip #1: Rooms at DKE are mostly deserted the days leading up to exams. 
Protip #2: Use 1.001/2.009 as your personal lair of studying, with optional private cinema display of Judge Dredd at the end of the day (beamer!)
Protip #3: CodePoKE (company founded by DKE students) provides a working spot for DKE students if the library &amp; DKE are too crowded. Often there are senior students there you can ask questions to.

</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="programming" class="anchor" href="#programming" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Programming</h3>

<ul>
<li>Programming subjects are ideal for self study. <br>
    <em>Your development environment (IDE) and compiler give you an interactive feedback loop that quickly allows you to learn how to properly program. You have an automated system that will provide you with corrections.</em>
</li>
<li>For those new to programming, realize that you are learning three things at once:

<ul>
<li>A new language; its syntax and vocabulary (API)</li>
<li>A new way of thinking; how to go from problem to code.</li>
<li>How to debug a logical program, and doubt everything about yourself. <br>
<em>Divide up the learning process into these three categories and tackle them individually</em>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you find that all of these things above are too much all at once, use an online code learning website such as codecombat.com. 

<ul>
<li>They tend to use a more forgiving language.</li>
<li>They provide more 'meaningful' and shorter challenges. Above all, they give proper hints and personal feedback.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Realize that truly learning how to program comes by doing projects of <em>your</em> interest.</li>
<li>If you don't know what <code>Stackoverflow</code> is, google it and learn to love it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="math" class="anchor" href="#math" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Math</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Realize that there is a ton of high-quality study material on the internet that you can partake in at your own speed, and ask questions on anonymously.</p>

<ul>
<li>Calculus: <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">https://www.khanacademy.org/</a>
</li>
<li>Linear Algebra: <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/</a>
</li>
<li>
<p>See MIT Opencourseware, Coursera, Udacity; etc.</p>

<pre><code>Caveat: Online videos aren't a replacement to lectures, as sometimes courses require specific techniques outlined in said lectures.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have trouble understanding certain concepts, try searching online for "visualizations". Most often someone made a very good visualization of concepts that you can interact with to grasp a subject in minutes, that normally through text can take forever to grasp.</p>

<ul>
<li>Eigenvalues &amp; vectors: <a href="http://setosa.io/ev/eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues/">http://setosa.io/ev/eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues/</a>
</li>
<li>Markov Chains: <a href="http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/">http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/</a>
</li>
<li>Machine Learning: <a href="http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/">http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/</a>
etc....</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Realize that doing the actual exercises is crucial for math courses.</li>
<li>Realize that you fundamentally lack the ability to review and correct your own exercises without outside help if you don't fully grasp the subject.

<ul>
<li>Get a solutions manual, preferable one that shows you the steps of calculation.</li>
<li>Setup a group of students to review the course material. Split it up the sessions in exercise making and theory review. Get an experienced student to help with the theory review.</li>
<li>Help a group of students if you are experienced. The best way to review theory is to see if you can explain it to someone else.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't miss a single lecture from Prof. Kelk. He is the best at explaining complex subjects.</p>

<pre><code>Seriously
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't miss a single lecture by Prof. Thuijsman. His syllabi tend to not cover techniques he explains in class.</p>

<pre><code>Double seriously, you'll hate yourself come exam.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
